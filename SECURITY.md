# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Instead, contact the maintainers privately so we can coordinate a fix and disclosure.

Preferred reporting:

- Email: security@adrian207 (placeholder)  
	Replace this with your preferred contact email address (for example: security@example.com) so reporters can reach you privately.
- GitHub security advisories are also supported â€” see repository settings.

We will respond promptly and coordinate disclosure and patches. On receiving a report we will:

1. Acknowledge receipt within 3 business days.
2. Triage and provide a timeframe for a fix.
3. Coordinate a disclosure date if the issue is not public.

If you prefer, update this file with a specific email address or instructions to direct reporters to a security contact on your organization/team.
