# Contributing to Entra-Hardening

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Small, focused contributions are welcome.

How to contribute:

- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- Use the issue templates for bug reports and feature requests.
- Fork the repo, create a branch, and open a pull request against `main`.

PR checklist:

- Use clear titles and descriptions.
- Ensure scripts run and do not break functionality.
- Update `README.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, or `docs/` when adding features or changing behavior.

Code style and testing:

- This repo uses PowerShell scripts organized under `Modules/` and `Common/`.
- Prefer PowerShell Core (7+) for local testing. Include PSVersion info in issues when relevant.

Maintainers will review PRs and may request changes. For larger features, open an issue first to discuss design.
